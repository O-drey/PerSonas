# PerSonas
Course : Mentored project
Status : In progress
Time : 1 month - 2021

This project highlights the difficulties faced by people with visual, hearing or cognitive disabilities. 
Digital technology is not always adapted to these marginalized people. For example, in September 2020, Youtube decided to stop the possibility of adding subtitles by the community, which makes the understanding of videos difficult or even impossible for people with hearing impairments and deaf people but also for people who do not understand well the language spoken by the content creators.

My project is a website that captures some of these difficulties through various effects such as blurring of text; color of text that is too light or too dark; lowering the volume and sometimes silencing the sound of a song; or the absence of subtitles. Effects are often chosen based on the text.
